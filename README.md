aaf_loadouts

Equipment for all!

TODO
- Have some standard items always added to arsenals. Can only think of sunnies type items & acre radios atm.
- Have some standard items on a per faction/camo are added to arsenals. This is for alternate uniform types, like rolled sleeves, normal, knee pads etc. Could possibly pick randomly from these for base uniform.
- Add in a function to call from the editor which will set all the units in the editor to their appropriate loadout, and sets up something so that the data will be inserted into the mission.
- Need to have a way so that loadouts not defined in a loadout... tree... are not throwing errors. I.e. incomplete loadout trees. Maybe have a base template that has all roles with "" for each thing?
- Make a function that checks if the current loadout data would be valid -> read from clipboard. A way to fast test for data validity.
- Need a way to import a loadout file in mission for quicker testing for non-modders.
- A way to do easy supply boxes. So something that could scale up/down for amount of players, pick out ammo for them from the loadouts, put down a crate.
options for medical resupply or not.
